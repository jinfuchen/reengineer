%\noindent \textbf{Motivation}

%In RQ1, we find that there exist prevalent performance regressions that are introduced by code changes. If we can understand what cause the introduction of these performance regressions, we may provide guidance or automated tooling support for developer to prevent the regressions during code change. 

\noindent \textbf{Data and Approach}
To address RQ3, we analyze and compare the regression coefficients of the logistic models from RQ1 and RQ2. In order to shed light on and better understand the factors that influence whether or not a change is defect inducing in different contexts (i.e., open source versus commercial), we highlight the most important factors in open source projects and compare them to commercial projects.
